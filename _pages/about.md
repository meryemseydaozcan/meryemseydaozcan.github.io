"I am Meryem Seyda Ozcan, a doctoral candidate in Developmental Psychology at Koç University, conducting my research in the Independent Evaluation Lab. I am also a visiting scholar at the CoDeS Lab at Virginia Tech. My research focuses on the intersection of cognitive development and technology, particularly how media and technology can enhance children's learning outcomes and cognitive skills. Throughout my academic journey, I have led interdisciplinary projects that explore how media use, contextual factors, and personalized technologies influence children’s cognitive and socioemotional development. I utilize a range of quantitative methods, including advanced statistical techniques, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, to gain insights that can improve educational practices.
My work is driven by a commitment to optimizing media and technology for positive developmental outcomes, providing actionable insights for parents, educators, and policymakers. I aim to bridge the gap between research and practice, creating educational solutions that empower children and foster their growth."
