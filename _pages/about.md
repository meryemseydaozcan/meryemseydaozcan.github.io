I am <strong>Meryem Seyda Ozcan</strong>, a Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href='http://kchoi.org/team/'>CoDeS Lab at Virginia Tech</a> working with Dr. Koeun Choi.

<strong>My research focuses on the intersection of cognitive development and technology</strong>, particularly how media and technology can enhance children's learning outcomes and cognitive skills. Throughout my academic journey, I have led interdisciplinary projects that explore how media use, contextual factors, and personalized technologies influence childrenâ€™s cognitive and socioemotional development. I utilize a range of quantitative methods, including advanced statistical techniques, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, to gain insights that can improve educational practices. <strong>My work is driven by a commitment to optimizing media and technology for positive developmental outcomes</strong>, providing actionable insights for parents, educators, and policymakers. I aim to bridge the gap between research and practice, creating educational solutions that empower children and foster their growth.
